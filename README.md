We built an NFT auction marketplace for valuable real-world assets (a "web3 ebay"). Like that, we add more utility to assets like gold coins, historical money, stamps and painting.

### Project Description: auction house for real-world assets

Our NFT auction-platform provides a cutting-edge marketplace where buyers and sellers can converge to engage in seamless transactions for real-world assets. Through a structured and secure process, we enable sellers to mint non-fungible tokens (NFTs) representing their valuable assets, while buyers can bid on these NFTs in an auction-style format. The result is an efficient, transparent, and trust-enhancing system for asset ownership transfer.

### Key Features:

1. Seller ID Validation: To ensure the authenticity and trustworthiness of sellers, we employ a rigorous ID validation process. Sellers must verify their identities, adding an extra layer of security and credibility to the platform.

2. NFT Minting: Sellers have the ability to mint NFTs that encapsulate essential information about their assets. The minting process includes critical details such as asset description, pricing, and certification, ensuring all necessary information is transparently stored.

3. Auction Listing: Once the NFT is minted, sellers can list their assets for auction on our platform. The auction mechanism is designed to foster competitive bidding, thereby maximizing the asset's potential value.

4. Automated Crypto Locking: To demonstrate a buyer's commitment during the auction, our platform automatically locks the bid amount in cryptocurrency. This feature guarantees that only serious buyers participate, enhancing the efficiency and integrity of the auction process.

5. Ownership Transfer: Upon the auction's conclusion, the winning bidder gains ownership rights over the NFT representing the asset. As NFTs are inherently unique and indivisible, the successful bidder now possesses a digital certificate of ownership for the real-world asset.

### Project Overview:

The project aims to create a mobile app that allows users to interact with tokenised assets on the Filecoin and IPFS decentralized storage networks. The app leverages WalletConnect for secure authentication and transaction signing, utilizes a custom-built DNFS API to interact with the decentralized file storage, and focuses on showcasing digital artwork like stamps.

**WalletConnect Integration:**
In this project, WalletConnect is integrated into the mobile app built using React Native. The app acts as a client for users to connect their cryptocurrency wallets securely.

**DNFS API:**
DNFS is a wallet-as-a-service provider to facilitate private-key management.

**Filecoin & IPFS:**
In this project, IPFS is used to store the digital artwork files. When a user uploads artwork like stamps through the app, the file is distributed across the IPFS network, ensuring redundancy and fault tolerance.

**Artwork Showcase: Use of the nouns artwork**
The project includes artwork from the popular nouns NFT collection (CC0 license). We used the nouns font, icons and color scheme.
